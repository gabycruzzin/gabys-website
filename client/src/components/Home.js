          <p>Hi there, I'm Gaby! ðŸ––</p>
          <p>Born and raised in Houston, TX.</p>
          <p>I initially thought I would major in Math, but changed my mind to purse Computer Science at the University of Houston. It was a very challenging four years, but I made it out alive with a useful skillset that would last me the rest of my life.</p>
          <p>I'm currently a Software Engineer at <Link to="/career" className="pLinks">JPMorgan Chase</Link> working on some pretty cool things.</p>
          <p>In my free time, I like to grow various types of <Link to="/interests" className="pLinks">cacti, practice hand-lettering, and eat good food.</Link></p>
          <p>Hope you enjoy my personal website - I made it from scratch using ReactJS, Node, HTML5, & CSS3! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
