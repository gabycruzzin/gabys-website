        <p>I was an active member of the <a class="pLinks" href="https://nscs.org/" target="_blank">National Society of Collegiate Scholars</a>, President & Public Relations officer of <a class="pLinks" href="https://csgirls.org/about/" target="_blank">CSGirls</a>.</p>
        <p>I was initially a Math major, almost switched to Computer Engineering, then eventually chose Computer Science as my degree. I'm glad I did, because I enjoy building websites like this one üíª</p>

        <p>After my summer internship, I was offered a full-time position at JPM as a Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>I started off with Java development, but eventually got boring to me. After some time, I inquired about getting Frontend Development tasks at work. It was so much better! Hehe. I think it's safe to say that I found my niche, because you have to use both creative AND puzzle-solving skills. ‚ú®</p>
